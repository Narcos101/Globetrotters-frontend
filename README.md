   - The frontend includes a Login Page, Registration Page, and Dashboard Page.

2. **Random Clues & Multiple Choice:**

   - The game presents 1â€“2 random clues for a randomly selected destination.
   - Users can select from multiple possible destination answers.

3. **Session Management:**

   - A new session is created every time a user starts the game.
   - Each round generates a new set of options, clues, and the correct answer.

4. **Funky Feedback System:**
